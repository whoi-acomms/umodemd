MAINTAINING

starting from fresh source, do this once:

  $ libtoolize
  $ ./bootstrap.sh
  $ ./configure
  $ make

except for projects which do not use libtool (not sure there are any).

thereafter, changes to configure.in and Makefile.am should only require:

  $ make

but, will sometimes require:

  $ ./bootstrap.sh
  $ ./configure
  $ make

so try that before googling the problem.

to keep configure.in up to date with portability issues:

  $ autoscan

to package a tag:

  $ make dist

DO NOT commit any of Doxyfile, Makefile.am, configure.in referencing a version
that has already been tagged and placed on acomms.whoi.edu/software

ideally, changes in major revision necessitate copying trunk to a branch.
e.g. when trunk will be going from v1.x to v2.0,

- commit all 1.x changes, tag and release if desired,

- copy foobar/trunk to foobar/branches/foobar1 using absolute URLs to stay
  in the repo; DO NOT commit your working copy as the old branch,

- change Doxyfile, Makefile.am, configure.in files in foobar/trunk to reflect the
  new major version, then commit,

- continue working in foobar/trunk working copy to do 2.0 work,

- checkout foobar/branches/foobar1 to a working copy to do 1.x work.
