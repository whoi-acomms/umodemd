BITTWISTB(1)                                                      BITTWISTB(1)



<h2>NAME</h2>
       bittwistb -- pcap based ethernet bridge

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
       bittwistb [ -dvh ] [ -i <u>interfaces</u> ]

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
       This document describes the <u>bittwistb</u> program, the <u>pcap</u>(3) based Ether-
       net bridge. <u>Bittwistb</u> is designed to allow a single host to do bridging
       on independent sets of Ethernet-type interfaces under Ethernet II (IEEE
       802.3) network with a MTU of up to 1500  bytes.  Since  <u>bittwistb</u>  uses
       functions  provided  by  <u>pcap</u>(3)  library,  e.g.  pcap_open_live()  and
       pcap_inject(), to capture and write packets, it may  require  that  you
       have  special  privileges, e.g. read access to <u>/dev/bpf*</u> on BSD or root
       access on Linux, to do the bridging or  to  enumerate  network  devices
       with, for example, the -d flag.

       <u>Bittwistb</u>  works  by polling, <u>poll</u>(2), for packets on all of the inter-
       faces supplied to the -i flag and forward them from  one  interface  to
       another according to the bridging rules below:

              Multicast  and  broadcast packets are always forwarded to all of
              the interfaces supplied to the -i flag except for the  interface
              on which the packets arrive.

              For  unicast  packets,  <u>bittwistb</u> learns which MAC addresses are
              associated with which interfaces and it will forward the packets
              selectively.  Like  most bridges, <u>bittwistb</u> uses a hash table to
              store known MAC addresses. Each entry in the hash table is  kept
              for at most 5 minutes.

       <u>Bittwistb</u>  terminates  when  it  receives  an interrupt signal, SIGINT,
       which is typically generated by typing Control-C.

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
       -d     Print a list of network interfaces available.

       -v     Print  forwarding  information  including  the  destination  and
              source MAC addresses of forwarded packets.

       -i <u>interfaces</u>
              List of comma separated Ethernet-type interfaces to bridge.
              Example: -i vr0,fxp0
              You can specify between 2 to 8 interfaces.

       -h     Print version information and usage.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
       <u>Bittwistb</u>  will,  if run with the -v flag, print forwarding information
       as shown in the example below:

              1 : root@localhost# bittwistb -i vr0,fxp0 -v
              2 : vr0=00:08:54:36:5e:01,port=1
              3 : fxp0=00:13:20:3e:ab:cf,port=2
              4 : [057451]mac=00:0d:61:b2:59:6b,port=1
              5 : dmac=ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff,smac=00:0d:61:b2:59:6b,outport=2
              6 : [056851]mac=00:13:46:76:20:13,port=1
              7 : dmac=01:00:5e:7f:ff:fa,smac=00:13:46:76:20:13,outport=2
              8 : [056851]deleted
              9 : [057451]deleted

       Line numbers are not visible in the actual output.  MAC  addresses  and
       ports  associated  with  the  interfaces  supplied  to  the -i flag are
       printed at line 2 and 3. At line 4, a new MAC address is stored in  the
       bridging  hash table at index 57451. This MAC address belongs to a host
       which resides on port 1, i.e. the first  LAN  segment.  At  line  5,  a
       broadcast  packet  is  forwarded out through all ports except port 1 of
       which the source MAC address resides on, hence the outport=2.  At  line
       6,  a  new MAC address which belongs to a host in the first LAN segment
       is stored at index 56851. At line 7, a multicast  packet  is  forwarded
       out  through  all  ports  except port 1 of which the source MAC address
       resides on, hence the outport=2. At line 8 and 9, entry 56851 and 57451
       are removed from the hash table after approximately 5 minutes.

       Under  normal  use,  we  do not recommend running <u>bittwistb</u> with the -v
       flag set as this may result in a poor bridging performance due  to  the
       standard I/O operation.

       Make  sure  you  are  using the latest stable version before submitting
       your bug report.

       If a known host relocates to another LAN segment, <u>bittwistb</u>  will  con-
       tinue  to forward packets destined to the host through its old LAN seg-
       ment. The presence of this host in a new  LAN  segment  is  known  only
       after at most 5 minutes.
