<h2>NAME</h2>
       bittwist -- pcap based ethernet packet generator

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
       bittwist [ -dvh ] [ -i <u>interface</u> ] [ -s <u>length</u> ] [ -l <u>loop</u> ]
                [ -c <u>count</u> ] [ -m <u>speed</u> ] [ -r <u>rate</u> ] [ -p <u>sleep</u> ]
                <u>pcap-file(s)</u>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
       This  document describes the <u>bittwist</u> program, the <u>pcap</u>(3) based Ether-
       net packet generator. <u>Bittwist</u> is designed to work  under  Ethernet  II
       (IEEE 802.3) network with a MTU of up to 1500 bytes on 10Mbps (10Base-T
       Ethernet) or 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) link speed. Packets are  generated
       from  saved  <u>tcpdump</u>(1)  capture file referred to as trace file in this
       document. Some familiarity with <u>tcpdump</u>(1) and its  basic  options  are
       assumed  in  this  document.  Since <u>bittwist</u> uses functions provided by
       <u>pcap</u>(3) library, e.g.  pcap_open_live()  and  pcap_inject(),  to  write
       packets  onto  the network, it may require that you have special privi-
       leges, e.g. read access to <u>/dev/bpf*</u> on BSD or root access on Linux, to
       generate packets or to enumerate network devices with, for example, the
       -d flag.

       <u>Bittwist</u> will, if not run with the -s flag, inject each  packet  up  to
       its actual length (on-wire) instead of its captured length. If the cap-
       tured length is less than the actual  length,  <u>bittwist</u>  will  pad  the
       packet  with zeros up to its actual length prior to injection. <u>Bittwist</u>
       will, if not run with the -m, -r, or -p flag,  inject  packets  from  a
       trace  file  based  on the captured intervals, in particular, the time-
       stamp difference between two adjacent packets,  except  for  the  first
       packet  in a trace file, which is always injected immediately. <u>Bittwist</u>
       is designed to not to interfere with the packet data; it merely read  a
       packet and inject it as is onto the network. If modification is desired
       prior to injection of a packet, you can use the  <u>bittwiste</u>(1)  program,
       which does just that.

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
       -d     Print a list of network interfaces available.

       -v     Print timestamp for each packet.

       -vv    Print timestamp and hex data for each packet.

       -i <u>interface</u>
              Send <u>pcap-file(s)</u> out onto the network through <u>interface</u>.

       -s <u>length</u>
              Packet length to send. Set <u>length</u> to:

              0 to send the actual packet length. This is the default.
              -1 to send the captured length.

              or any other value from 14 to 1514.

       -l <u>loop</u>
              Send  <u>pcap-file(s)</u> out onto the network for loop times. Set loop
              to 0 to send <u>pcap-file(s)</u> until stopped. To stop, type  Control-
              C.

       -c <u>count</u>
              Send  up  to  count packets. Default is to send all packets from
              <u>pcap-file(s)</u>.

       -m <u>speed</u>
              Set interval multiplier to <u>speed</u>. Set <u>speed</u> to 0 or less to send
              the next packet immediately. Minimum positive value for <u>speed</u> is
              0.000001.

       -r <u>rate</u>
              Limit the sending to <u>rate</u> Mbps. Value for <u>rate</u> must be between 1
              to  1000.  This  option  is  meant  to  limit the maximum packet
              throughput.  If you  want  to  send  packets  at  line  rate  of
              100Mbps, try -m 0 -r 100

       -p <u>sleep</u>
              Set  interval  to <u>sleep</u> (in seconds), ignoring the actual inter-
              val. Value for <u>sleep</u> must be between 1 to 2146.

       -h     Print version information and usage.

<h2>BUGS</h2>
       File your bug report and send to:

              Addy Yeow Chin Heng &lt;<a href="mailto:ayeowch@gmail.com">ayeowch@gmail.com</a>&gt;

       Make sure you are using the latest  stable  version  before  submitting
       your bug report.

       If you run <u>bittwist</u> with -m flag set to 0 without limiting the through-
       put with -r flag, pcap_inject() may return an error with the  following
       error string:

              send: No buffer space available

       We  recommend that you specify the -r flag to limit the packet through-
       put, e.g. -m 0 -r 100 to inject packets at a maximum rate of 100Mbps.
