About create2

The test application in ROHC need binary files of packages.

This is a program that generates binary files from the output of the tcpdump command.

    use like this to create 10 udp packages

    tcpdump -c 10 -s 0 -e -n -x -S udp > file
    less file | ./create2

It creates files like flow-XXXX-ip.bin were the XXXX is replaced by the number of the package.

Then it is just to run the testapp like this

 ./testapp -s ./flow
