Instructions for ROHC with PPPoE setup over WaveLan.


Installing the wave-lan card
----------------------------
Installation of wavelan-card "Orinoco" with a cardbus PCI to PCMCIA adapter.

Software:
Redhat 8.0 with Linux kernel 2.4.20 (from www.kernel.org).

Hardware:
CardBus bridge: Texas Instruments PCI1410 PC card Cardbus Controller
"Lucent Technologies", "WaveLAN/IEEE", "Version 01.01" (Orinoco)

We got it working with the kernel configuration (2.4.20) in appendix A.
When you have compiled and installed the kernel you can use

	/sbin/cardmgr

to make the card working, check with lsmod so that the following modules are loaded:
	orinoco_cs
	orinoco
	hermes

Then install the network interface card with "redhat-config-network".
Check with /sbin/ifconfig so your new card is installed.


Setup for PPPoE and PPP.
------------------------

To be able to use PPPoE in Kernel the following modules must be enabled in Kernel (2.4.20)

	CONFIG_PPP=m
	CONFIG_PPP_ASYNC=m
	CONFIG_PPP_SYNC_TTY=m
	CONFIG_PPP_DEFLATE=m
	CONFIG_PPP_BSDCOMP=m
	CONFIG_PPPOE=m
	CONFIG_N_HDLC=m
	CONFIG_UNIX98_PTYS=y

Copy if_ppp.h from ROHCs source code and place it in the include/linux directory for
the Kernel source code.

You must also create a /dev/ppp file:

	mknod --mode=664 /dev/ppp c 108 0

Then you have to add the following lines in /etc/modules.conf:

	alias char-major-108 ppp_generic
	alias tty-ldisc-3 ppp_async
	alias tty-ldisc-13 n_hdlc
	alias tty-ldisc-14 ppp_synctty
	alias net-pf-24 pppoe

Before compiling the PPP daemon, version 2.4.2(b1) you must replace 4 files. The files can be found in the pppd/ directory
in ROHCs source code directory. Then use the instructions that follows with pppd to compile pppd.
The following row must be added in /etc/ppp/options after you have compiled pppd.

	plugin /etc/ppp/plugins/rp-pppoe.so

Unpack rp-pppoe-3.5 and in its src/ folder typ the following

	./configure ?enable-plugin=/path/to/pppd-source-code/pppd
	make
	make install

Start your adsl-setup (version 3.5 /usr/sbin/adsl-setup) and answer its questions.

Edit /etc/ppp/pppoe.conf and change the following:

        LINUX_PLUGIN=/etc/ppp/plugins/rp-pppoe.so
	LCP_INTERVAL=3600
	LCP_FAILURE=100

If you want the connection to be permanent and not change IP during inactivity, change "PPPOE-TIMEOUT=80" to "PPPOE-TIMEOUT=".

ROHC Installation
----------------------

Now you have to install ROHC, make sure that there are no PPP-connection, then in the ROHC source code type the following two commands:

	make module
	make install

To make the PPP-connection use ROHC, the following command must be used before the client and the server is started.

	insmod rohc

The Graphic user interface for controll/benchmark and the packetgenerator are both compiled with the following commands:

	make -f Makefile.dist
	./configure
	make
	make install

If you have followed all of the instructions above, your ROHC modified ppp-connection are ready to use.
Just follow the instructions below to create a ppp0 interface.


PPPoE-Server:
-------------
Edit /etc/ppp/pppoe-server-options when pppoe is installed, remove "require-pap" so it looks like this:

	# PPP options for the PPPoE server
	# LIC: GPL
	# require-pap        <==
	login
	lcp-echo-interval 10
	lcp-echo-failure 2

To start the server type the following (v3.5 /usr/sbin/pppoe-server):

	pppoe-server -k -I <Interface for instance eth1>


PPPoE-Client:
-------------

When the server is started the client can connect by typing adsl-start (version 3.5 /usr/sbin/adsl-start).

If a ppp-connection is established the server and the client should have a ppp0-interface. /sbin/ifconfig should give something like this.

ppp0      Link encap:Point-to-Point Protocol
          inet addr:10.0.0.1  P-t-P:10.67.15.1  Mask:255.255.255.255
          UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:1492  Metric:1
          RX packets:47549 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:47549 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:3
          RX bytes:3994020 (3.8 Mb)  TX bytes:3993894 (3.8 Mb)

### ONLY TOUCH THE FOLLOWING SETTINGS IF YOU'RE AN EXPERT

# How long adsl-start waits for a new PPP interface to appear before
# concluding something went wrong.  If you use 0, then adsl-start
# exits immediately with a successful status and does not wait for the
# link to come up.  Time is in seconds.
#
# WARNING WARNING WARNING:
#
# If you are using rp-pppoe on a physically-inaccessible host, set
# CONNECT_TIMEOUT to 0.  This makes SURE that the machine keeps trying
# to connect forever after adsl-start is called.  Otherwise, it will
# give out after CONNECT_TIMEOUT seconds and will not attempt to
# connect again, making it impossible to reach.

# How often in seconds adsl-start polls to check if link is up

# Three files are actually used:

# Do you want to use synchronous PPP?  "yes" or "no".  "yes" is much
# easier on CPU usage, but may not work for you.  It is safer to use
# "no", but you may want to experiment with "yes".  "yes" is generally
# safe on Linux machines with the n_hdlc line discipline; unsafe on others.
SYNCHRONOUS=no

# Do you want to clamp the MSS?  Here's how to decide:
# - If you have only a SINGLE computer connected to the ADSL modem, choose
#   "no".
# - If you have a computer acting as a gateway for a LAN, choose "1412".
#   The setting of 1412 is safe for either setup, but uses slightly more
#   CPU power.

# PPPOE_EXTRA="-f 3c12:3c13 -S ISP"

# Any extra arguments to pass to pppd.  Normally, use a blank string

# Example:
# OVERRIDE_PPPD_COMMAND="pppd call dsl"

# If you want adsl-connect to exit when connection drops:
# RETRY_ON_FAILURE=no
